# Notebook Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to **Notebook Tic-Tac-Toe**, a web-based version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game designed to bring back the nostalgic memories of school days. This project recreates the feel of playing on a notebook page, complete with lined paper backgrounds and handwritten-style fonts — just like doodling in your school notebook during class!

## Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players alternate placing their marks ('X' and 'O') to try and get three in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If the grid fills with no winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Key Features

- **Classic Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay:** Two players take turns placing X’s and O’s on a 3x3 grid aiming to align three in a row.  
- **Custom Player Names:** Players can enter their own names before starting the game to personalize the experience.  
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps a running score for both players, updating after every win.  
- **Responsive Board:** The game board dynamically resets after each round to continue playing.  
- **Stylish Notebook Theme:** Background mimics lined notebook paper, with playful handwritten fonts to enhance nostalgia.  
- **Clean UI:** Clear buttons for starting and resetting the game.  
- **Input Validation:** Disallows placing marks on already occupied cells.  
- **Win and Draw Detection:** Accurately detects wins and ties, with alert messages to notify players.  
- **Simple and Lightweight:** Built using plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for easy understanding and customization.

## User Interface & Design

- The background uses a repeating linear gradient that resembles lined paper, giving a real notebook feel.  
- Font choice is ‘Gloria Hallelujah’, a handwritten cursive font from Google Fonts, to mimic writing in a notebook.  
- The game container has a dashed border with a red accent on the left, resembling a notebook margin.  
- Input boxes and buttons are styled with dashed borders and subtle hover effects to keep a casual school vibe.  
- The game board cells have a simple white background with dashed borders and change color based on the player mark (blue for X and red for O).  
- The scoreboard updates dynamically and uses large, readable fonts to show the scores clearly.

## How It Works

### Game Setup

- Players enter their names and press the Start Game button.  
- The game board appears with an empty 3x3 grid.  
- The scoreboard shows the player names and their current scores (starting at zero).

### Gameplay

- Players alternate turns, clicking on empty cells to place their mark (X or O).  
- The game logic prevents clicking on already occupied cells.  
- After each move, the game checks if there is a winner or if the game ended in a draw.  
- If a player wins, an alert announces the winner and the scoreboard updates.  
- If the game is a draw (all cells filled with no winner), an alert announces the draw.  
- The board resets automatically after a win or draw, keeping the scores intact.

### Resetting the Game

- The Reset Game button resets scores and clears the board for a fresh start.  
- Player names remain visible but the game needs to be started again.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5:** Structure of the page and game elements.  
- **CSS3:** Styling for notebook theme, layout, and interactive effects.  
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Core game logic, event handling, game state management, and dynamic UI updates.  
- **Google Fonts:** ‘Gloria Hallelujah’ for that handwritten feel.

## Why This Project?

This project is not just about coding a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It’s about combining simple, familiar gameplay with a nostalgic and playful design that connects users to memories of school days. The handwritten font and notebook paper background are deliberate design choices to create a cozy, relatable atmosphere.

It’s perfect for:

- Beginners learning how to build interactive web apps.  
- Anyone wanting a fun, easy-to-understand game.  
- People who love nostalgic, school-themed projects.
